Hey stranger :), this is the humans.txt for my personal webpage.

The idea of this file is to document the _humans_ behind a webpage
that made it possible.

I'm using [Hugo], a static site generator to build the site locally,
review the contents, then publish it to GitHub pages.

One particular project that I'm very glad exists is [KaTeX], the tool I use
for pre-rendering math to HTML/CSS so you wouldn't have to do it client-side,
let alone run any JavaScript.

The stylesheet is a modified version of [Simple.css].
